RuleList:
  101: "101 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nAll players must always abide by all the rules then in\
    \ effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial\
    \ Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules\
    \ 101-116 (immutable) and 201-216 (mutable). \n "
  102: "102 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nInitially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules\
    \ in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is,\
    \ changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable\
    \ regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted\
    \ regardless of their numbers. \n "
  103: "103 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nA rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment,\
    \ repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment\
    \ of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable\
    \ rule into a mutable rule or vice versa. \n "
  104: "104 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nAll proposed rule-changes must be written down. If they\
    \ are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.\
    \ \n "
  105: "105 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nAll rule-changes put to a vote in the proper way shall\
    \ be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes. \n "
  106: "106 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nNo rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment\
    \ of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly\
    \ states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application. \n "
  107: "107 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nEach proposed rule-change put to a vote shall be given\
    \ a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each proposed\
    \ rule-change put to a vote in the proper way shall receive the next successive\
    \ integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted. \n \nWhen a rule-change is\
    \ adopted in the proper way, the rule it enacts receives said rule-change\u2019\
    s number. \n "
  108: "108 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nRule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable\
    \ rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible\
    \ voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in\
    \ a proposal to take effect. \n "
  109: "109 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nIn a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule,\
    \ the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void.\
    \ For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does\
    \ not \"conflict\" with that immutable rule. \n \nIf two or more mutable rules\
    \ conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one\
    \ another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence. \n \n\
    If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers\
    \ to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or\
    \ type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for\
    \ determining precedence. \n \nIf two or more rules claim to take precedence over\
    \ one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.\
    \ \n "
  110: "110 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nA player always has the option to forfeit the game rather\
    \ than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing,\
    \ in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed. \n "
  111: "111 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nThe adoption of rule-changes must never become completely\
    \ impermissible. \n "
  112: "112 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nRules can change their own text or repeal themselves.\
    \ Rules cannot make any other changes to the rules unless the explicit authority\
    \ for such a change is already present. \n "
  113: "113 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nVotes must be unambiguous. A vote that would be ambiguous\
    \ is not considered to be a vote. Additional rules may be made to clarify what\
    \ constitutes ambiguity.  \n "
  114: "114 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nServer moderators regulate the server and game. Their\
    \ responsibilities include the creation of text and voice channels, the designation\
    \ of which messages and actions go in which channels, the editing or deleting\
    \ of messages that are inappropriate for the channel that they are in, and keeping\
    \ track of the state of the game. \n \nThis game adheres to the Discord Terms\
    \ of Service and the Discord Community Guidelines. Moderators are empowered to\
    \ remove content that violates the terms and guidelines as well as sanction violating\
    \ persons, up to and including banning. \n \nA person is a server moderator if\
    \ and only if they have the \"Moderator\" role. \n "
  115: "115 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nAll actions, including voting, endorsing, and rule-change\
    \ proposals, must occur in the channel or channels that are designated for them.\
    \ Any action that does not occur in said action\u2019s designated channel or channels\
    \ is not considered a valid action. \n "
  116: "116 (IMMUTABLE) \n \nWhatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is\
    \ permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which\
    \ is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits\
    \ it. \n \n "
  201: "201 \n \nThe Proposal Queue is a queue that proposed rule-changes, or proposals,\
    \ go on. Players may have up to one proposal in the Proposal Queue. Active players\
    \ may create a proposal to go on the Proposal Queue at any time; if a player that\
    \ already has a proposal on the Proposal Queue creates another one, the first\
    \ proposal is removed. Players may also remove their proposals from the Proposal\
    \ Queue without replacement. Proposals may not be edited. \n "
  202: "202 \n \nActive players may endorse any number of proposals in the Proposal\
    \ Queue, including their own. Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted first\
    \ in descending order of number of active endorsing players, then in ascending\
    \ order of proposal creation time. \n "
  203: "203 \n \nOne turn consists of taking a proposal off the front of the Proposal\
    \ Queue, and having a vote on whether or not to adopt it. The voting period ends\
    \ when the turn ends. \nIf the proposal queue is empty at the start of the turn,\
    \ then no vote will be held. The duration of the turn will be unaffected. \n \n\
    The length of a turn defaults to 24 hours. \n "
  204: "204 \n \nA rule-change is adopted if and only if it receives a simple majority\
    \ of votes in favor of its passing. Every active player is an eligible voter.\
    \ \n \nOther rules may introduce additional conditions necessary for a proposed\
    \ rule-change to be adopted, notwithstanding the above paragraph. \n "
  205: "205 \n \nAn adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the start\
    \ of the turn following the turn that it was adopted on. \n "
  206: "206 \n \nAll players start the game as active. An active player becomes inactive\
    \ (*i.e.* loses their active status) if said active player has publicly declared\
    \ that they are now inactive. Other rules may also grant and revoke activity status.\
    \ \n \nA player that has become inactive via public declaration may become active\
    \ again by attempting to cast a vote or endorse a proposal (the vote or endorsement\
    \ will be counted as though the player had cast or granted it while active) or\
    \ by publicly declaring that they are active. \n "
  207: "207 \n \nPlayers that are required by the rules to perform an action have\
    \ a total of 48 hours to perform said action. A player that does not perform said\
    \ action within the allotted 48 hours becomes inactive until either they do perform\
    \ said action or said action becomes impossible to perform. \n "
  208: "208 \n \nEach player always has exactly one vote. \n "
  209: "209 \n \nPlayers may change their votes by voting again. Players may withdraw\
    \ their votes with the phrase \u201Cwithdraw\u201D. Players may not edit or delete\
    \ their votes (*i.e.* alter the voting record). A vote that is edited loses its\
    \ vote status. \n \nPlayers may grant and withdraw their endorsements freely and\
    \ at any time. \n "
  210: "210 \n \nThe following phrases, and only the following phrases, are considered\
    \ to be unambiguous affirmative votes: \n \n* aye \n* yay \n* yes \n* y \n \n\
    The following phrases, and only the following phrases, are considered to be unambiguous\
    \ negative votes: \n \n* nay \n* no \n* n \n \nPhrases for voting are case-insensitive.\
    \ \n "
  211: "211 \n \nIf a section of a rule relies on a bot to be implemented to the point\
    \ where its manual implementation would be infeasible, and there is no such bot,\
    \ then said rule\u2019s section is void until said bot is functional. \n "
  212: "212 \n \nAll players start with 0 points. The winner is the first player to\
    \ achieve 100 (positive) points. \n "
  213: "213 \n \nThe state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered\
    \ from achieving *n* points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of *n*\
    \ and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner\
    \ when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended\
    \ or repealed. \n "
  214: "214 \n \nIf players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation\
    \ or application of a rule, then an eligible player is to be the Judge and decide\
    \ the question. Said player is to be selected uniformly at random. Disagreement\
    \ for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player.\
    \ This process is called invoking Judgment. \n \nA player is eligible to be selected\
    \ as Judge if and only if all of the following are true: \n \n* The player is\
    \ active \n* The player has voted on a proposal during the turn that Judgment\
    \ was called or the turn before Judgment was called \n* The player has not proposed\
    \ a rule-change currently being voted on \n* The player has not yet been Judge\
    \ this turn \n \nWhen Judgment is invoked for the first time in a turn, the current\
    \ turn is extended by 24 hours unless the scheduled end of the turn was already\
    \ more than 24 hours after Judgment\u2019s invocation. If the turn is extended\
    \ in this manner, and there are still more than 24 hours left in the turn, a majority\
    \ of active players may consent to revoke the extension. \n \nThe Judge's Judgment\
    \ may be overruled only by either a unanimous vote of the other active players\
    \ taken before the next turn is begun or a majority vote of server moderators\
    \ before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then another\
    \ eligible player becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on. \n \nThe\
    \ server moderators can only overrule a Judge\u2019s Judgment if the Judgment\
    \ egregiously conflicts with the rules and would cause lasting damage to the game.\
    \ A majority vote of the other active players, taken before the next turn is begun,\
    \ may nullify the overruling, in which case the original Judgment stands, the\
    \ original Judge resumes their position as Judge, all Judgments issued by Judges\
    \ between the overruling and the nullification of the overruling are nullified,\
    \ and the server moderators are barred from overruling the Judge for the remainder\
    \ of the turn.  \n \nUnless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions\
    \ arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to\
    \ his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge. \n \nNew Judges are not\
    \ bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those\
    \ questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion\
    \ of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be\
    \ in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent,\
    \ inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider\
    \ game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards. \n "
  215: "215 \n \nIf the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if\
    \ the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's\
    \ best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then\
    \ the proposer of the proposal up for vote is the winner. If there is no proposal\
    \ up for vote, then the proposer of the proposal at the front of the Proposal\
    \ Queue at the time the game has become unplayable is the winner. If the Proposal\
    \ Queue is empty, then there is no winner. \n \nThis rule takes precedence over\
    \ every other rule determining the winner. \n "
  216: "216 \n \nPersons wishing to become players may join by requesting to do so\
    \ publicly. Persons may not act as multiple players at once. Persons that are\
    \ found to have done this are banned from the game. \n"
