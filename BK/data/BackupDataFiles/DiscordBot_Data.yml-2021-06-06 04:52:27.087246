      File: "Amend Rule 302 to:\n\nA function is a type of bot-exclusive action. Any\
        \ action taken by a bot either automatically or as a result of the prompting\
        \ of player commands is considered a function. Aspects of bots such as whether\
        \ or not a bot is on the Nomic V server, which category a bot falls under,\
        \ or whether a bot is open source, are not considered functions.\n\nBots can\
        \ be delineated into two categories: Utility and Non-utility.\n\nUtility bots\
        \ are those which interact with the game in a meaningful way. This means that\
        \ one or more of the bot\u2019s functions is described in the rules. This\
        \ can be directly through explicit mention of the bot being intended to perform\
        \ a function or indirectly if anything described in the rules is fulfilled\
        \ by a bot in practice as a function.\n\nNon-utility bots are those which\
        \ do not interact with the rules in a meaningful way. This means that, though\
        \ a Non-utility bot may be mentioned by name in the rules, none of said bot\u2019\
        s functions may be described in the rules.\n\nIf a Utility bot is not open\
        \ source it must be made open source within one day of this sentence being\
        \ ratified in the rules, within one day of it being added to the server, or\
        \ within one day of it becoming a Utility bot. If this grace period ends and\
        \ the bot is still not open source, the bot must be removed from the server.\
        \ Bots removed from the server in this manner cannot be added back to the\
        \ server until they become open source. If Judgement is called to determine\
        \ whether a bot is Utility or Non-utility, it cannot be removed from the server\
        \ before the final Judgement is given, regardless of if the grace period expires.\
        \ If a Judge finds a bot to be a Utility bot and it is not already open source,\
        \ a new day-long grace period begins. If a Utility bot which was open source\
        \ stops being open source, a new day-long grace period begins. If for any\
        \ reason a bot has multiple grace periods, only the newest one is applicable,\
        \ and any older ones are null and void."
