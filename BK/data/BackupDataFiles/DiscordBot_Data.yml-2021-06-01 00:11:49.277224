      File: "Bee Movie Script\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccording to all known laws\r\nof aviation,\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nthere is no way a bee\r\nshould be able to fly.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        Its wings are too small to get\r\nits fat little body off the ground.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\r\n\r\n  \r\nbecause bees don't care\r\
        \nwhat humans think is impossible.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\
        \nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOoh, black and yellow!\r\nLet's\
        \ shake it up a little.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry! Breakfast is ready!\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \nOoming!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHang on a second.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHello?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        - Barry?\r\n- Adam?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oan you believe this is happening?\r\n\
        - I can't. I'll pick you up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLooking sharp.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUse\
        \ the stairs. Your father\r\npaid good money for those.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry.\
        \ I'm excited.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere's the graduate.\r\nWe're very proud of you,\
        \ son.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA perfect report card, all B's.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVery proud.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nMa! I got a thing going here.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got lint on your\
        \ fuzz.\r\n- Ow! That's me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\r\
        \n- Bye!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, I told you,\r\nstop flying in the house!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\n- Hey, Adam.\r\n- Hey, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that fuzz gel?\r\n\
        - A little. Special day, graduation.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNever thought I'd make it.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nThree days grade school,\r\nthree days high school.\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \nThose were awkward.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThree days college. I'm glad I took\r\n\
        a day and hitchhiked around the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did come back different.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\n- Hi, Barry.\r\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\n- Hear about Frankie?\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You going to the funeral?\r\
        \n- No, I'm not going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody knows,\r\nsting someone, you\
        \ die.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\r\nSuch a hothead.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nI guess he could have\r\njust gotten out of the way.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        I love this incorporating\r\nan amusement park into our day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        That's why we don't need vacations.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\r\
        \nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\r\n\
        - We are!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Bee-men.\r\n- Amen!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHallelujah!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\r\n\r\n  \r\nplease welcome\
        \ Dean Buzzwell.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\r\ngraduating class of...\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\n...9:15.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nAnd begins your career\r\nat Honex Industries!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWill we\
        \ pick ourjob today?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard it's just orientation.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nHeads up! Here we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKeep your hands and antennas\r\n\
        inside the tram at all times.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wonder what it'll be like?\r\n\
        - A little scary.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWelcome to Honex,\r\na division of Honesco\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nand a part of the Hexagon Group.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is it!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nWow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe know that you, as a bee,\r\n\
        have worked your whole life\r\n\r\n  \r\nto get to the point where you\r\n\
        can work for your whole life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen\r\
        \nJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur top-secret formula\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nis automatically color-corrected,\r\nscent-adjusted and bubble-contoured\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\ninto this soothing sweet syrup\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith its distinctive\r\
        \ngolden glow you know as...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That girl\
        \ was hot.\r\n- She's my cousin!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- She is?\r\n- Yes, we're all\
        \ cousins.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Right. You're right.\r\n- At Honex, we constantly\
        \ strive\r\n\r\n  \r\nto improve every aspect\r\nof bee existence.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nThese bees are stress-testing\r\na new helmet technology.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\n- What do you think he makes?\r\n- Not enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere we\
        \ have our latest advancement,\r\nthe Krelman.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What does that\
        \ do?\r\n- Oatches that little strand of honey\r\n\r\n  \r\nthat hangs after\
        \ you pour it.\r\nSaves us millions.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan anyone work on the Krelman?\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nOf course. Most bee jobs are\r\nsmall ones. But bees know\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nthat every small job,\r\nif it's done well, means a lot.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nBut choose carefully\r\n\r\n  \r\nbecause you'll stay in the job\r\n\
        you pick for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe same job the rest of\
        \ your life?\r\nI didn't know that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's the difference?\r\n\
        \r\n  \r\nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\r\nas a species, haven't had\
        \ one day off\r\n\r\n  \r\nin 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo you'll just\
        \ work us to death?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe'll sure try.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow! That blew\
        \ my mind!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"What's the difference?\"\r\nHow can you say that?\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nOne job forever?\r\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\r\nto make one decision in life.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nBut, Adam, how could they\r\nnever have told us that?\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nWhy would you question anything?\r\nWe're bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're\
        \ the most perfectly\r\nfunctioning society on Earth.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou ever\
        \ think maybe things\r\nwork a little too well here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLike what?\
        \ Give me one example.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know. But you know\r\nwhat I'm\
        \ talking about.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPlease clear the gate.\r\nRoyal Nectar Force\
        \ on approach.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a second. Oheck it out.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey,\
        \ those are Pollen Jocks!\r\n- Wow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've never seen them this\
        \ close.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey know what it's like\r\noutside the hive.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nYeah, but some don't come back.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, Jocks!\r\n- Hi,\
        \ Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou guys did great!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're monsters!\r\n\
        You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I wonder where they\
        \ were.\r\n- I don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTheir day's not planned.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nOutside the hive, flying who knows\r\nwhere, doing who knows what.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\r\nJock. You have to be bred\
        \ for that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook. That's more pollen\r\n\
        than you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's just a status symbol.\r\
        \nBees make too much of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\r\
        \nand the ladies see you wearing it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose ladies?\r\nAren't\
        \ they our cousins too?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDistant. Distant.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at\
        \ these two.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\r\n- Let's have fun with\
        \ them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt must be dangerous\r\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\r\nagainst a mushroom!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe\
        \ had a paw on my throat,\r\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\n- Oh, my!\r\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat\
        \ were you doing during this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTrying to alert the authorities.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nI can autograph that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA little gusty out there today,\r\
        \nwasn't it, comrades?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah. Gusty.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're hitting\
        \ a sunflower patch\r\nsix miles from here tomorrow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Six miles,\
        \ huh?\r\n- Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nA puddle jump for us,\r\nbut maybe you're\
        \ not up for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Maybe I am.\r\n- You are not!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        We're going 0900 at J-Gate.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\r\n\
        Are you bee enough?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI might be. It all depends\r\non what 0900\
        \ means.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, Honex!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDad, you surprised me.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nYou decide what you're interested in?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, there's\
        \ a lot of choices.\r\n- But you only get one.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo you ever get\
        \ bored\r\ndoing the same job every day?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSon, let me tell you\
        \ about stirring.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou grab that stick, and you just\r\nmove it\
        \ around, and you stir it around.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\r\
        \nIt's a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, Dad,\r\nthe more I think\
        \ about it,\r\n\r\n  \r\nmaybe the honey field\r\njust isn't right for me.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nYou were thinking of what,\r\nmaking balloon animals?\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nThat's a bad job\r\nfor a guy with a stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJanet, your\
        \ son's not sure\r\nhe wants to go into honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Barry, you are\
        \ so funny sometimes.\r\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're\
        \ not funny! You're going\r\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \n- You're gonna be a stirrer?\r\n- No one's listening to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        Wait till you see the sticks I have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could say anything right\
        \ now.\r\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's open some honey\
        \ and celebrate!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\r\nShave my antennae.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nShack up with a grasshopper. Get\r\na gold tooth and call everybody\
        \ \"dawg\"!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm so proud.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- We're starting work\
        \ today!\r\n- Today's the day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on! All the good jobs\r\n\
        will be gone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPollen counting, stunt\
        \ bee, pouring,\r\nstirrer, front desk, hair removal...\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is\
        \ it still available?\r\n- Hang on. Two left!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOne of them's yours!\
        \ Oongratulations!\r\nStep to the side.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What'd you get?\r\n\

        \n\r\n  \r\nYes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMake your\
        \ choice.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You want to go first?\r\n- No, you go.\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \nOh, my. What's available?\r\n\r\n  \r\nRestroom attendant's open,\r\nnot\
        \ for the reason you think.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Any chance of getting the Krelman?\r\
        \n- Sure, you're on.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nWax monkey's always open.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Krelman opened up again.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\n  \r\nA bee died. Makes an opening. See?\r\
        \nHe's dead. Another dead one.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.\r\

        \ got a bit of a kick.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat is one nectar collector!\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\n- Ever see pollination up close?\r\n- No, sir.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI pick\
        \ up some pollen here, sprinkle it\r\nover here. Maybe a dash over there,\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\na pinch on that one.\r\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nThat's amazing. Why do we do that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's pollen\
        \ power. More pollen, more\r\nflowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\r\n\
        \r\n  \r\nOool.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.\r\nOould\
        \ be daisies. Don't we need those?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOopy that visual.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nWait. One of these flowers\r\nseems to be on the move.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        Say again? You're reporting\r\na moving flower?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAffirmative.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nThat was on the line!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is the coolest. What is\
        \ it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know, but I'm loving this color.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        It smells good.\r\nNot like a flower, but I like it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, fuzzy.\r\

    \ rule into a mutable rule or vice versa. \n \n"

    \ the question. Said player is to be selected uniformly at random. Disagreement\
    \ for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player.\
    \ This process is called invoking Judgment. \n \nA player is eligible to be selected\

    \ active \n* The player has voted on the most recent proposal put to vote, or\

    \ than two proposals have been put to vote since the start of the game \n* The\
    \ player has not proposed a rule-change currently being voted on \n* The player\

    \ time in a turn, the current turn is extended by 24 hours unless the scheduled\
    \ end of the turn was already more than 24 hours after Judgment\u2019s invocation.\
    \ If the turn is extended in this manner, and there are still more than 24 hours\

    \ \n \nThe Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by either a unanimous vote of\
    \ the other active players taken before the next turn is begun or a majority vote\
    \ of server moderators before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is\
    \ overruled, then another eligible player becomes the new Judge for the question,\
    \ and so on. \n \nThe server moderators can only overrule a Judge\u2019s Judgment\

    \ Judgment stands, the original Judge resumes their position as Judge, all Judgments\
    \ issued by Judges between the overruling and the nullification of the overruling\
    \ are nullified, and the server moderators are barred from overruling the Judge\
    \ for the remainder of the turn.  \n \nUnless a Judge is overruled, one Judge\
    \ settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including\
    \ questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge. \n \nNew\
    \ Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however,\
    \ settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that\
    \ affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions\
    \ by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when\
    \ the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the\
    \ Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying\
    \ other standards. \n \n"
  215: "215 \n \nIf the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if\
    \ the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's\
    \ best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then\
    \ the proposer of the proposal up for vote is the winner. If there is no proposal\
    \ up for vote, then the proposer of the proposal at the front of the Proposal\
    \ Queue at the time the game has become unplayable is the winner. If the Proposal\
    \ Queue is empty, then there is no winner. \n \nThis rule takes precedence over\
    \ every other rule determining the winner. \n \n"
  216: "216 \n \nPersons wishing to become players may join by requesting to do so\
