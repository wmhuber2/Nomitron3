      File: "Bee Movie Script\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccording to all known laws\r\nof aviation,\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nthere is no way a bee\r\nshould be able to fly.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        Its wings are too small to get\r\nits fat little body off the ground.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\r\n\r\n  \r\nbecause bees don't care\r\
        \nwhat humans think is impossible.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\
        \nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOoh, black and yellow!\r\nLet's\
        \ shake it up a little.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry! Breakfast is ready!\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \nOoming!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHang on a second.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHello?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        - Barry?\r\n- Adam?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oan you believe this is happening?\r\n\
        - I can't. I'll pick you up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLooking sharp.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUse\
        \ the stairs. Your father\r\npaid good money for those.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry.\
        \ I'm excited.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere's the graduate.\r\nWe're very proud of you,\
        \ son.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA perfect report card, all B's.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVery proud.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nMa! I got a thing going here.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got lint on your\
        \ fuzz.\r\n- Ow! That's me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\r\
        \n- Bye!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, I told you,\r\nstop flying in the house!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\n- Hey, Adam.\r\n- Hey, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that fuzz gel?\r\n\
        - A little. Special day, graduation.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNever thought I'd make it.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nThree days grade school,\r\nthree days high school.\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \nThose were awkward.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThree days college. I'm glad I took\r\n\
        a day and hitchhiked around the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did come back different.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\n- Hi, Barry.\r\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\n- Hear about Frankie?\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You going to the funeral?\r\
        \n- No, I'm not going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody knows,\r\nsting someone, you\
        \ die.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\r\nSuch a hothead.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nI guess he could have\r\njust gotten out of the way.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        I love this incorporating\r\nan amusement park into our day.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        That's why we don't need vacations.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\r\
        \nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\r\n\
        - We are!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Bee-men.\r\n- Amen!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHallelujah!\r\n\r\

        \ Dean Buzzwell.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\r\ngraduating class of...\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\n...9:15.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nAnd begins your career\r\nat Honex Industries!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWill we\
        \ pick ourjob today?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard it's just orientation.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nHeads up! Here we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKeep your hands and antennas\r\n\
        inside the tram at all times.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wonder what it'll be like?\r\n\
        - A little scary.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWelcome to Honex,\r\na division of Honesco\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nand a part of the Hexagon Group.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is it!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nWow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe know that you, as a bee,\r\n\
        have worked your whole life\r\n\r\n  \r\nto get to the point where you\r\n\
        can work for your whole life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen\r\
        \nJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur top-secret formula\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nis automatically color-corrected,\r\nscent-adjusted and bubble-contoured\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\ninto this soothing sweet syrup\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith its distinctive\r\
        \ngolden glow you know as...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That girl\
        \ was hot.\r\n- She's my cousin!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- She is?\r\n- Yes, we're all\
        \ cousins.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Right. You're right.\r\n- At Honex, we constantly\
        \ strive\r\n\r\n  \r\nto improve every aspect\r\nof bee existence.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nThese bees are stress-testing\r\na new helmet technology.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\n- What do you think he makes?\r\n- Not enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere we\
        \ have our latest advancement,\r\nthe Krelman.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What does that\
        \ do?\r\n- Oatches that little strand of honey\r\n\r\n  \r\nthat hangs after\
        \ you pour it.\r\nSaves us millions.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan anyone work on the Krelman?\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nOf course. Most bee jobs are\r\nsmall ones. But bees know\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nthat every small job,\r\nif it's done well, means a lot.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nBut choose carefully\r\n\r\n  \r\nbecause you'll stay in the job\r\n\
        you pick for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe same job the rest of\
        \ your life?\r\nI didn't know that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's the difference?\r\n\
        \r\n  \r\nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\r\nas a species, haven't had\
        \ one day off\r\n\r\n  \r\nin 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo you'll just\
        \ work us to death?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe'll sure try.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow! That blew\
        \ my mind!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"What's the difference?\"\r\nHow can you say that?\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nOne job forever?\r\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\r\nto make one decision in life.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nBut, Adam, how could they\r\nnever have told us that?\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nWhy would you question anything?\r\nWe're bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're\
        \ the most perfectly\r\nfunctioning society on Earth.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou ever\
        \ think maybe things\r\nwork a little too well here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLike what?\
        \ Give me one example.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know. But you know\r\nwhat I'm\
        \ talking about.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPlease clear the gate.\r\nRoyal Nectar Force\
        \ on approach.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a second. Oheck it out.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey,\
        \ those are Pollen Jocks!\r\n- Wow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've never seen them this\
        \ close.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey know what it's like\r\noutside the hive.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nYeah, but some don't come back.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, Jocks!\r\n- Hi,\
        \ Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou guys did great!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're monsters!\r\n\
        You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I wonder where they\
        \ were.\r\n- I don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTheir day's not planned.\r\n\r\n \
        \ \r\nOutside the hive, flying who knows\r\nwhere, doing who knows what.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\r\nJock. You have to be bred\
        \ for that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook. That's more pollen\r\n\
        than you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's just a status symbol.\r\
        \nBees make too much of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\r\
        \nand the ladies see you wearing it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose ladies?\r\nAren't\
        \ they our cousins too?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDistant. Distant.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at\
        \ these two.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\r\n- Let's have fun with\
        \ them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt must be dangerous\r\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\r\nagainst a mushroom!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe\
        \ had a paw on my throat,\r\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\n- Oh, my!\r\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat\
        \ were you doing during this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTrying to alert the authorities.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nI can autograph that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA little gusty out there today,\r\
        \nwasn't it, comrades?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah. Gusty.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're hitting\
        \ a sunflower patch\r\nsix miles from here tomorrow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Six miles,\
        \ huh?\r\n- Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nA puddle jump for us,\r\nbut maybe you're\
        \ not up for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Maybe I am.\r\n- You are not!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        We're going 0900 at J-Gate.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\r\n\
        Are you bee enough?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI might be. It all depends\r\non what 0900\
        \ means.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, Honex!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDad, you surprised me.\r\n\r\
        \n  \r\nYou decide what you're interested in?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, there's\
        \ a lot of choices.\r\n- But you only get one.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo you ever get\
        \ bored\r\ndoing the same job every day?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSon, let me tell you\
        \ about stirring.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou grab that stick, and you just\r\nmove it\
        \ around, and you stir it around.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\r\
        \nIt's a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, Dad,\r\nthe more I think\
        \ about it,\r\n\r\n  \r\nmaybe the honey field\r\njust isn't right for me.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nYou were thinking of what,\r\nmaking balloon animals?\r\n\r\n\
        \  \r\nThat's a bad job\r\nfor a guy with a stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJanet, your\
        \ son's not sure\r\nhe wants to go into honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Barry, you are\
        \ so funny sometimes.\r\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're\
        \ not funny! You're going\r\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \n- You're gonna be a stirrer?\r\n- No one's listening to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        Wait till you see the sticks I have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could say anything right\
        \ now.\r\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's open some honey\
        \ and celebrate!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\r\nShave my antennae.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nShack up with a grasshopper. Get\r\na gold tooth and call everybody\
        \ \"dawg\"!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm so proud.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- We're starting work\
        \ today!\r\n- Today's the day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on! All the good jobs\r\n\
        will be gone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPollen counting, stunt\
        \ bee, pouring,\r\nstirrer, front desk, hair removal...\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is\
        \ it still available?\r\n- Hang on. Two left!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOne of them's yours!\
        \ Oongratulations!\r\nStep to the side.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What'd you get?\r\n\

        \n\r\n  \r\nYes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMake your\
        \ choice.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You want to go first?\r\n- No, you go.\r\n\r\n  \r\
        \nOh, my. What's available?\r\n\r\n  \r\nRestroom attendant's open,\r\nnot\
        \ for the reason you think.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Any chance of getting the Krelman?\r\
        \n- Sure, you're on.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nWax monkey's always open.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Krelman opened up again.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\n  \r\nA bee died. Makes an opening. See?\r\

        \  \r\n- Ever see pollination up close?\r\n- No, sir.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI pick\
        \ up some pollen here, sprinkle it\r\nover here. Maybe a dash over there,\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\na pinch on that one.\r\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nThat's amazing. Why do we do that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's pollen\
        \ power. More pollen, more\r\nflowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\r\n\
        \r\n  \r\nOool.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.\r\nOould\
        \ be daisies. Don't we need those?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOopy that visual.\r\n\r\n\

        Say again? You're reporting\r\na moving flower?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAffirmative.\r\
        \n\r\n  \r\nThat was on the line!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is the coolest. What is\
        \ it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know, but I'm loving this color.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\
        It smells good.\r\nNot like a flower, but I like it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, fuzzy.\r\

RuleList:
  101: 'Rule 101/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in
    which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever
    a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-117 (immutable) and 201-219
    (mutable).'
  102: 'Rule 102/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Initially rules in the 100''s are immutable and rules in the 200''s are mutable.
    Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable
    or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules
    in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.'
  103: 'Rule 103/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment
    of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of
    a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule
    or vice versa.'
  104: 'Rule 104/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted
    if and only if they receive the required number of votes.'
  105: 'Rule 105/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they
    are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.'
  106: 'Rule 106/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the
    vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change
    may have retroactive application.'
  107: "Rule 107/0 (IMMUTABLE)\n\nEach proposed rule-change shall be given a number\
    \ for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed\
    \ in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not\
    \ the proposal is adopted.\n\nWhen a rule-change is adopted in the proper way,\
    \ the rule it enacts receives said rule-change\u2019s number."
  108: 'Rule 108/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted
    if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation
    shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.'
  109: 'Rule 109/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes
    precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this
    rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable
    rule.'
  110: 'Rule 110/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play
    or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the
    player to incur it, may be imposed.'
  111: 'Rule 111/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.'
  112: 'Rule 112/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Rule-changes that directly or indirectly affect the methods by which the rules
    are changed are as permissible as other rule-changes.'
  113: 'Rule 113/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Rules can change their own text or repeal themselves. Rules cannot make any other
    changes to the rules unless the explicit authority for such a change is already
    present.'
  114: 'Rule 114/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Votes must be unambiguous. A vote that would be ambiguous is not considered to
    be a vote. Additional rules may be made to clarify what constitutes ambiguity.'
  115: 'Rule 115/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Server administrators and moderators regulate the server and game. Their responsibilities
    include the creation of text and voice channels, the designation of which messages
    and actions go in which channels, the editing or deleting of messages that are
    inappropriate for the channel that they are in, and keeping track of the state
    of the game. The server administrator may override the decision of a server moderator,
    and may grant and revoke moderator status to persons.


    A person is a server administrator if and only if they have the "Administrator"
    role. A person is a server moderator if and only if they have the "Moderator"
    role.'
  116: "Rule 116/0 (IMMUTABLE)\n\nAll actions, including voting and rule-change proposals,\
    \ must occur in the channel or channels that are designated for them. Any action\
    \ that does not occur in said action\u2019s designated channel is not considered\
    \ a valid action."
  117: 'Rule 117/0 (IMMUTABLE)


    Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated,
    with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a
    rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.'
  201: "Rule 201/0\n\nPlayers shall initially alternate in a random order to be determined\
    \ by the server administrator by the start of the game, taking one whole turn\
    \ apiece. Players joining the game will have their turn order set to precede the\
    \ player that is taking their turn at the time of the player\u2019s joining. Turns\
    \ belonging to active players may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns\
    \ belonging to active players may not be omitted. All players begin with zero\
    \ points."
  202: 'Rule 202/0


    One turn consists of proposing one rule-change and having it voted on.'
  203: 'Rule 203/1


    A rule-change is adopted if a simple majority of eligible voters vote for it.
    This majority must be more than 15% of total players.'
  204: 'Rule 204/0


    An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the start of the turn
    following the turn that it was adopted on.'
  205: 'Rule 205/0


    Every active player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate
    in every vote on rule-changes.'
  206: 'Rule 206/1


    The length of a turn defaults to 24 hours. If the player whose turn it is has
    made a proposal, the length of the turn is extended by 24 more hours. If, at the
    24-hour mark of a turn, all active players have cast an unwithdrawn vote on the
    current revision of the proposal, and Judgment has not been invoked during said
    turn, the above extension is revoked and the turn ends immediately.'
  207: "Rule 207/0\n\nAn active player becomes inactive (i.e. loses their active status)\
    \ if any of the following criteria are met:\n\n* It is the active player\u2019\
    s turn, and said player has not made a proposal by the end of their turn\n\n*\
    \ It is not the active player\u2019s turn, a proposal has been put forward during\
    \ the turn, and said player has not voted on said proposal by the end of the turn\n\
    \n* The active player has publicly declared that they are now inactive\n\nPlayers\
    \ that have become inactive through the above methods may become active again\
    \ by attempting to cast a vote (the vote will be counted as though it was cast\
    \ when they were active) or by publicly declaring that they are active.\n\nPlayers\
    \ may declare inactivity during their turn. The turn will not end immediately,\
    \ but any proposal made during the turn is treated as though it does not exist.\
    \ A player that declares inactivity during their turn cannot become active for\
    \ the duration of said turn.\n\nIf an inactive player\u2019s turn would start,\
    \ their turn is skipped instead."
  208: 'Rule 208/0


    Each player always has exactly one vote.'
  209: 'Rule 209/0


    Players may change or withdraw their votes by stating their intention to do so.
    Players may not edit or delete their votes (i.e. alter the voting record). A vote
    that is edited loses its vote status.'
  210: 'Rule 210/1


    Proposals may not be edited after they are submitted for voting. A proposal may
    be resubmitted up to two times a turn but may not be resubmitted if the turn has
    started more than 24 hours ago. Resubmitting a proposal restarts the vote on the
    proposal.


    If at the 24hr mark of a turn if 75% of the votes for the current proposal have
    the word "extend" (not case sensitive) then the current turn is extended another
    24hrs, the current player can propose an additional time, and they are allowed
    to proposal up to 48hrs after their turn is started'
  211: "Rule 211/0\n\nIf a section of a rule relies on a bot to be implemented to\
    \ the point where its manual implementation would be infeasible, and there is\
    \ no such bot, then said rule\u2019s section is void until said bot is functional."
  212: 'Rule 212/0


    At the end of a player''s turn, 1d6 points are added to their score.'
  213: 'Rule 213/0


    The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.'
  214: 'Rule 214/0


    If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable
    rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number
    takes precedence.


    If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers
    to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type
    of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
    precedence.


    If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to
    one another, then the numerical method again governs.'
  215: "Rule 215/0\n\nIf players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation\
    \ or application of a rule, then the active player preceding the one moving is\
    \ to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this\
    \ rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called\
    \ invoking Judgment.\n\nWhen Judgment is invoked for the first time in a turn,\
    \ the current turn is extended by 24 hours unless the scheduled end of the turn\
    \ was already more than 24 hours after Judgment\u2019s invocation. If the turn\
    \ is extended in this manner, and there are still more than 24 hours left in the\
    \ turn, a majority of active players may consent to revoke the extension.\n\n\
    The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by either a unanimous vote of the other\
    \ active players taken before the next turn is begun or the server administrator\
    \ before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the\
    \ active player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge\
    \ for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his\
    \ or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.\n\nThe server administrator\
    \ can only overrule a Judge\u2019s Judgment if the Judgment egregiously conflicts\
    \ with the rules and would cause lasting damage to the game. A majority vote of\
    \ the other active players, taken before the next turn is begun, may nullify the\
    \ overruling, in which case the original Judgment stands, the original Judge resumes\
    \ their position as Judge, all Judgments issued by Judges between the overruling\
    \ and the nullification of the overruling are nullified, and the server administrator\
    \ is barred from overruling the Judge for the remainder of the turn.\n\nUnless\
    \ a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game\
    \ until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy\
    \ and jurisdiction as Judge.\n\nNew Judges are not bound by the decisions of old\
    \ Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players\
    \ currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment\
    \ was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules\
    \ then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the\
    \ point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of\
    \ the game before applying other standards."
  216: 'Rule 216/0


    The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving
    n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the means of earning
    points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue
    may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.'
  217: 'Rule 217/0


    If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality
    of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge''s best reasoning,
    not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player
    unable to complete a turn is the winner.


    This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.'
  218: 'Rule 218/0


    Persons wishing to become players may request to do so publicly. Within 24 hours
    of the request, if no player has publicly objected or privately objected (to a
    server moderator or administrator) to a player joining the game, that player will
    join the game. If a player has objected, a vote is immediately held on whether
    or not the person joins the game. If there is a majority vote in favor after 24
    hours of the start of the vote, that player will join the game.


    Persons may not pretend to be multiple players at once. Persons that are found
    to have done this are banned from the game.'
  219: 'Rule 219/1


    Players that are required by the rules to perform an action have a total of 48
    hours to perform said action unless otherwise specified. A player that does not
    perform said action within the allotted 48 hours becomes inactive until either
    they do perform said action or said action becomes impossible to perform.'
  303: 'Rule 303/0


    Proposals are not allowed to distinguish those who voted for it, those who voted
    against it, or those who did not vote on it from each other.'
  304: "Rule 304/0\n\nUpon the event that players do not have an idea for a proposal,\
    \ on their turn they can invoke a phone a friend action in the actions channel\
    \ requesting ideas for proposals to submit. This action must be invoked in the\
    \ first 12 hours of a players turn. Other players can then suggest ideas for a\
    \ proposal. Other players are limited to submitting 1 suggestion, and these suggestions\
    \ must be unique from others for this turn. A random suggestion is taken for a\
    \ proposal, this is done 12 hours after the phone a friend action. If there is\
    \ a question raised of the \u201Cuniqueness\u201D of suggestions, judgement must\
    \ be invoked, and all but the earliest suggestion will be thrown out. The picked\
    \ suggestion is posted with an @ to the current player, and they have the option\
    \ of taking the suggestion word for word, or editing it then posting to the voting\
    \ channel. If a suggestion is taken word for word suggester gains 3 points upon\
    \ a passed proposal, or they lose 1 point upon the failure of the proposal.  If\
    \ a suggestion is taken but not copy and pasted, the suggestor gains 1 point upon\
    \ success, and nothing upon failure. If at any point the current player comes\
    \ up with their own idea for a proposal so long as it is unique to all suggestions\

  317: "Rule 317/1\n\nAn action is a direct change to the state of the game. An action\
    \ can be directly player-initiated or created as the result of an ability.\n\n\
    An ability is a property that each player may or may not have. Abilities create\
    \ actions depending on what triggers that the ability has. Actions created by\
    \ an ability are treated as though they were initiated by the originator of said\
    \ ability.\n\nAn action is either an inalienable action or an actionable action.\
    \ Actionable actions are further divided into immediate actionable action and\
    \ delayed actionable actions. Abilities have the same classification. An ability\
    \ of any given type will create actions with the corresponding type.\n\nAction\
    \ stacks are stacks that delayed actionable actions are pushed on to, popped off\
    \ from, or created in. Only delayed actionable actions may go on action stacks.\
    \ If at any point a delayed actionable action on an action stack ceases to be\
    \ a delayed actionable action, it is removed from its action stack. If the former\
    \ delayed actionable action is still an action, it is simultaneously put into\
    \ action.\n\nWhen an action exerts its stated effect on the game, that action\
    \ is said to be \"put into action\".\n\nAn inalienable action or an immediate\
    \ actionable action is put into action the moment it is performed or created,\
    \ and is irreversible save for Judgment that it was performed or created illegally.\
    \ A delayed actionable action is pushed onto a specific action stack when it is\
    \ performed or created. If an action stack and all of the actions that it contains\
    \ have been unmodified for four consecutive hours, the action stack will pop actions\
    \ until either a new action has been placed onto said action stack or said action\
    \ stack is empty, at which point it is deleted. Actions popped in this manner\
    \ are put into action unless they are blocked or don't meet their prerequisites\
    \ at the time they are popped. Popped actions occur consecutively.\n\nIf an action\
    \ has a cost, said cost must be paid to perform said action. Costs to perform\
    \ an action are paid the moment said action is performed and are not part of the\
    \ action itself. Paying a cost to perform an action is itself an immediate actionable\
    \ action.\n\nWhile on its action stack, a delayed actionable action may be blocked,\
    \ removed, copied, or modified by other actions that target said delayed actionable\
    \ action.\n* When an action that blocks a target delayed actionable action is\
    \ put into action, the target action is blocked\n* When an action that removes\
    \ a target delayed actionable action is put into action, the target action is\
    \ removed from its action stack.\n* When an action that copies a target delayed\
    \ actionable action is put into action, a copy of the target action is pushed\
    \ onto a specific stack. The copy of the action is identical to the target action\
    \ at the time that it was copied, save that it is treated as though it was performed\
    \ by the player who performed the action that copied the action that the copy\
    \ of the action was copied from. \n* When an action that modifies a target delayed\
    \ actionable action is put into action, the target action is modified as the targeting\
    \ action specifies, keeping both its action stack and its placement on its action\
    \ stack.\n\nActions may not target themselves. If an action that is put into action\
    \ would target an action not on its action stack, it instead does nothing.\n\n\
    By default, performing or creating a delayed actionable action creates a new action\
    \ stack and pushes said action onto it. A player can choose to push a newly-performed\
    \ action of theirs on top of a preexisting action stack by specifying that they\
    \ are doing so. Stating that an action is going on the same stack that some specific\
    \ action is or was on is sufficient specification.\n\nPerformed or created actions\
    \ that target a specific action automatically go on the same action stack as said\
    \ specific action, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding. If an action\
    \ targets actions on multiple action stacks, all action stacks containing action\
    \ that said action targets are merged, and said action is pushed onto the merged\
    \ stack. Actions in the merged stack are sorted chronologically, with the action\
    \ created most recently on the top of the action stack and the action created\
    \ least recently on the bottom of the action stack.\n\nCopied delayed actionable\
    \ action are put onto the same stack that they would be were the copied delayed\
    \ actionable action a performed delayed actionable action, with the exception\
    \ that the player who copied the copied delayed actionable action cannot choose\
    \ to push said copied delayed actionable action onto an action stack with no action\
    \ that said copied delayed actionable action targets.\n\nAll actions and abilities\
    \ defined or regulated by the Initial Set (i.e. actions defined or regulated by\
    \ any rule with a rule number less than 300) are classified as inalienable, while\
    \ all other actions and abilities are classified as actionable. All actionable\
    \ actions are immediate actionable actions unless otherwise stated, and all actionable\
    \ abilities are immediate actionable abilities unless otherwise stated."

    \ becomes Judge, the case is suspended until they are no longer Judge.\n\nA court\
    \ channel will be used for criminal proceedings. Only the Prosecutor, Defense,\
    \ Criminal Judge, and any Appeals Judges may use the court channel. A Judge may\
    \ also use the court channel if Judgment is currently invoked.\n\nIf the prosecutor\
    \ proves beyond a reasonable doubt to the Criminal Judge that the Defense is guilty\
    \ of breaking a rule, or if the Defense pleads guilty to the offense during or\
    \ prior to the start of the trail, then the Defense is convicted of breaking said\
    \ rule. It is the Criminal Judge\u2019s job to then declare the Defendant\u2019\
    s guilt or innocence and, if the former was declared, assign a punishment.\n\n\
    The severity of a Criminal Judge\u2019s punishment is largely dependent on the\
    \ severity of the crime itself. On a guilty verdict, the Criminal Judge classifies\
    \ the crime under one of three different categories:\n\u2022 Misdemeanors are\
    \ the class of reversible crimes.\n\u2022 Felonies are the class of irreversible\
    \ crimes.\n\u2022 War Crimes are the class of irreversible crimes that do excessive\
    \ harm to the game. \n\nThe Prosecutor and Defense take turns making opening statements,\
    \ arguments, and closing statements. Opening statements, arguments, and closing\
    \ statements must be submitted within 24 hours of the previous statement. A Prosecutor\
    \ or Defense that fails to do so within the allotted time is considered to have\
    \ made a blank statement at the end of the allotted time. Once closing statements\
    \ are done, the Criminal Judge has 24 hours to make a verdict and post it. If\
    \ 24 hours pass without such a verdict the Criminal Judge is considered to have\
    \ automatically posted an innocent verdict.\n\nAfter the verdict is posted roles\
    \ of Criminal Judge, Prosecutor, Defense, and Suspicari Criminalibus are removed.\n\
    \nThe following are established punishments to crimes, however, it is up to the\
    \ Criminal Judge to augment or reduce punishment, taking into account the severity\
    \ of the offense, whether or not the offense was a repeated one, the Defense\u2019\
    s plea, and other relevant context:\n\u2022 If the Defense is charged with a Misdemeanor,\
    \ and the Misdemeanor is not a repeat offense, then they are given a warning.\n\
    \u2022 If the Defense is charged with a Misdemeanor, and the Misdemeanor is a\
    \ repeat offense, then they are restricted in a manner to inhibit repetition of\
    \ the crime, and a bail is posted. If this bail is paid, then the restrictions\
    \ are removed. The length of time that a player is restricted may is up to the\
    \ judge's prerogative. \n\u2022 If the Defense is charged with a Felony, and the\
    \ Felony is not a repeat offense, then they are given a warning, temporary restriction\
    \ or are somehow publicly shamed in a manner that does not impact the game state.\
    \ Additionally, bail is posted. If this bail is paid, then the restrictions and/or\
    \ humiliation are removed. \n\u2022 If the Defense is charged with a Felony, and\
    \ the Felony is a repeat offense, then they are banned from performing actionable\
    \ actions for a certain duration and fined. The player may be banned from Nomic\
    \ if sufficient intent and malice are both demonstrated.\n\u2022 All War Crimes\
    \ are punishable by ban from Nomic or perpetual restrictions and extensive fines.\n\
    \nIf new evidence comes to light or it was discovered that legal errors were made\
    \ in a previous criminal trial, then an appeals court may be convened. The validity\
    \ of convening an appeals court is determined by said appeals court. A player\
    \ must formally request an appeals court be formed and present said new evidence\
    \ or legal errors.\n\nFollowing the request, three Appellate Judges are convened\
    \ in an appeals court using the same method as a Criminal Judge, with the additional\
    \ restriction that the Criminal Judge for the criminal trial being appealed cannot\
    \ be an Appellate Judge. (The Prosecutor and Defense, for the purposes of convening\
    \ Appellate Judges, are considered to be the same players that they were in the\
    \ criminal trial being appealed.)\n\nThe Appellate Judges first must determine\
    \ the validity of the appeal by majority vote.\nIf said appeal is deemed valid\
    \ then the criminal case referred to by the appeal is reopened with the same Prosecutor\
    \ and Defense. The appeals court is then held exactly as a criminal court with\
    \ the Appellate Judges taking the place of the Criminal Judge and with their verdict\
    \ and sentencing decided by a majority vote between them. As with a Criminal Judge\u2019\
    s verdict, an Appellate Judge\u2019s absence of a verdict after 24 hours of the\
    \ closing statements is considered to be a vote for an innocent verdict.\n\nAll\
    \ crimes are tried in accordance with the ruleset at the time said rule was broken.\
    \ No crimes may be charged against a rule ex post facto. \n\nIn the event that\

    a specific position in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana is said to be fixed. If
    the location of a fixed card is changed such that it is not known where it is
    in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana, or if a card is never fixed in the first place,
    it is said to be unfixed. To actively unfix a card means to put it randomly back
    in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana.


    Each unique card c in the Minor Arcana has relative weight wc = 2^(-kc) where
    kc is equal to the number of copies of c that are currently fixed. When a card
    is fixed, it becomes unique card c with probability wc/W, where W is the sum of
    all relative weights.


    Players start out with five cards in their hand, which is unordered. They can
    draw up to two additional cards, consecutively or simultaneously, at any point
    in their turn. At the end of their turn, if they have more than seven cards in
    their, hand, they must unfix cards in their hand until they have exactly seven
    cards in their hand.


    If multiple cards are drawn simultaneously, each card will be fixed using the
    same weights, and weights and probabilities will be recalculated only after drawing
    is finished. All cards that players start with are considered to be drawn simultaneously.'
  330: "Rule 330/1\n\nOnce per turn, a player may DISCARD a card onto a discard pile.\
    \ The card at the top of the discard pile is fixed, with all other cards in the\
    \ discard pile being unfixed.\n\nTo DISCARD, a player first draws a card from\
    \ the top of the Major Deck of Minor Arcana, then puts one card in their hand\
    \ on top of the discard pile.\n\nThe Pot is a collection of coins, starting empty.\
    \ Players also start with 0 coins.\n\nA deal is a period of time starting after\
    \ the Pot is emptied (or, if the Pot had never been emptied, the enactment of\
    \ this rule) and ending when the Pot is next emptied.\n\nThe following effects\
    \ are take effect when a player discards a card, but before it is placed on the\
    \ discard pile:\n\u2022 When a COIN card is DISCARDED, a number of coins equal\
    \ to the DISCARDED card's rank, or 11 if the DISCARDED card is ranked higher than\
    \ Ten, is added to the Pot \n\u2022 When a SWORD card is DISCARDED, the top card\
    \ of the discard pile is inserted into the Major Deck of Minor Arcana with its\
    \ ordinal position from the top equal to the DISCARDED card's rank, or at the\
    \ top if the DISCARDED card's rank is greater than Ten\n\u2022 When a WAND card\
    \ is DISCARDED, the top card is added to the hand of the player that DISCARDED\
    \ the DISCARDED card.\n\u2022 When a CUPS card is DISCARDED, the card in the Major\
    \ Deck of Minor Arcana with the ordinal position from the top equal to the DISCARDED\
    \ card's rank, or the top card in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana if the DISCARDED\
    \ card's rank is greater than Ten, becomes fixed if it was unfixed and unfixed\
    \ if it was fixed. This does not change the ordinal position of the cards above\
    \ the specified card.\n\nIf a player has not DISCARDED a card on the current turn,\
    \ that player may SUBMIT 5 cards from their hand. The SUBMITTED cards are unfixed.\n\
    \nAt the end of the next turn after the first SUBMISSION since the Pot was last\
    \ emptied, the player out of all the players who SUBMITTED during the current\
    \ deal who can form the best five-card hand using the cards that they SUBMITTED\
    \ during the current deal and the card presently on top of the discard pile wins\
    \ the Pot, and gets all the coins in it. If two or more players have equally good\
    \ hands, then they split the pot as evenly as possible, with the remaining coins\
    \ prioritized to the players whose SUBMISSIONS this deal were the earliest. All\
    \ players who SUBMITTED in this most recent deal then draw 3 cards simultaneously,\
    \ and the next deal begins.\n\nHands are ranked as follows, in descending order.\
    \ If a hand fits the criteria of two different categories, it is considered to\
    \ be the higher category:\n\u2022 **Quintuplet**: All five cards in the hand have\
    \ the same rank and suit\n\u2022 **Quadruplet**: Four cards in the hand have the\
    \ same rank and suit\n\u2022 **Full family**: Three cards in the hand have one\
    \ combination of rank and suit, with the two other cards in the hand having a\
    \ different combination of rank and suit\n\u2022 **Five of a kind**: All five\
    \ cards in the hand have the same rank\n\u2022 **Straight flush**: All five cards\
    \ have sequential rank and the same suit\n  \u25E6 For the purposes of a straight\
    \ flush, an Ace card may count as either ranked under a Two or above a King, but\
    \ not both in the same hand\n\u2022 **Triplet**: Three cards in the hand have\
    \ the same rank and suit\n\u2022 **Four of a kind**: Four cards in the hand have\
    \ the same rank\n\u2022 **Two twin**: Two cards in the hand have one combination\
    \ of rank and suit, with two other cards in the hand having a different combination\
    \ of rank and suit\n\u2022 **Full house**: Three cards in the hand have one rank,\
    \ with the two other cards in the hand having a different rank\n\u2022 **Straight**:\
    \ All five cards have sequential rank\n  \u25E6 For the purposes of a straight,\
    \ an Ace card may count as either ranked under a Two or above a King, but not\
    \ as both in the same hand\n\u2022 **Flush**: All five cards have the same suit\n\
    \u2022 **Three of a kind**: Three cards in the hand have the same rank\n\u2022\
    \ **One twin**: Two cards in the hand have the same rank and suit\n\u2022 **Two\
    \ pair**: Two cards in the hand have one rank, with two other cards in the hand\
    \ having a different rank\n\u2022 **One pair**: Two cards in the hand have the\
    \ same rank\n\u2022 **High card**: The hand does not meet any of the above criteria\n\
    \nHands are further ranked by the ranks of their collections of same-ranked cards,\
    \ first in order by the size of the collection and then by the rank of the collection.\
    \ For example, a full house hand would be further ranked first by the rank of\
    \ its triplet and then by the rank of its twin, while a two pair hand would be\
    \ further ranked first by the rank of its higher-ranked pair, then by the rank\
    \ of its lower-ranked pair, and finally by the rank of its remaining card.\n\n\
    A collection of same-ranked cards that is larger than one card must contribute\
    \ to the overall rank of the hand in order to be treated as such. For example,\
    \ a flush hand would be further ranked using only collections of size 1, while\
    \ a one twin hand would only count its same-suit pair as a collection of size\
    \ 2, regardless of the existence of any different-suited pair in the hand.\n\n\
    Straight hands and straight flush hands are instead further ranked by the highest-ranked\
    \ card in the hand. If, for the purposes of the straight hand or straight flush\
    \ hand, an Ace card was counted as having ranked under a Two, then it would likewise\
    \ be considered as ranked under a Two when further ranking the hand.\n\nAt any\
    \ time a player may convert four of their coins to a single point. This process\
    \ is not reversible."
  336: 'Rule 336/0


    Any player can declare any other player ''stinky'' at any time by spending one
    point.

    Users declared stinky will be marked with a special ''stinky'' role, that changes
    role usernames to brown and grants access to the exclusive ''little stinkers''
    chat, while removing access from the equally exclusive ''squeaky sweeties'', which
    is available to all non-stinky players.

    Players declared stinky cannot declare other players stinky, nor can they be declared
    unstinky, except by spending one point.

    At the end of the round, a random active player who is not stinky will be given
    a random number of points between one and six, this player will be immediately
    declared stinky.'
  338: 'Rule 338/0


    Players may on any turn, once per round, request the removal of an emoji from
    the game. This request is done in #actions. A vote is then called in #actions  to
    determine if the emoji is removed or stays. Simple majority vote determines the
    outcome. The vote ends at the end of the current turn. A removal request cannot
    be made 6 hours before the end of a turn.'
  341: "Rule 341/0\n\nAll players start with 9 marbles.\nPlayers who lose all their\
    \ marbles cannot gain points or perform actionable actions for 1 turn. \nPlayers\
    \ gain a marble for every turn they are inactive up to a maximum of 9.\nMarbles\
    \ are tradable if both parties agree in actions, and players cannot trade away\
    \ all their marbles.\nMarbles have a random Type when created.\n\nPlayers who\
    \ collect a marble of each type can trade them in for an Infinity Marble and get\
    \ 5 points. Infinity marbles can be consumed to replace a die roll with a fixed\
    \ value for one event."
