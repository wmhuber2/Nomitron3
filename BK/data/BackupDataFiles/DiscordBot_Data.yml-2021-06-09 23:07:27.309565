    \ of server moderators before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is\
    \ overruled, then another eligible player becomes the new Judge for the question,\
    \ and so on. \n \nThe server moderators can only overrule a Judge\u2019s Judgment\
    \ if the Judgment egregiously conflicts with the rules and would cause lasting\
    \ damage to the game. A majority vote of the other active players, taken before\
    \ the next turn is begun, may nullify the overruling, in which case the original\
    \ Judgment stands, the original Judge resumes their position as Judge, all Judgments\
    \ issued by Judges between the overruling and the nullification of the overruling\
    \ are nullified, and the server moderators are barred from overruling the Judge\
    \ for the remainder of the turn.  \n \nUnless a Judge is overruled, one Judge\
    \ settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including\
    \ questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge. \n \nNew\
    \ Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however,\
    \ settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that\
    \ affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions\
    \ by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when\
    \ the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the\
    \ Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying\
    \ other standards. \n \n"
  215: "215 \n \nIf the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if\
    \ the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's\
    \ best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then\
    \ the proposer of the proposal up for vote is the winner. If there is no proposal\
    \ up for vote, then the proposer of the proposal at the front of the Proposal\
    \ Queue at the time the game has become unplayable is the winner. If the Proposal\
    \ Queue is empty, then there is no winner. \n \nThis rule takes precedence over\
    \ every other rule determining the winner. \n \n"
