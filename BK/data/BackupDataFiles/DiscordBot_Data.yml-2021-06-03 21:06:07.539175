        \ players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application\
        \ of a rule, all parties will compete in a \u201CLift-Off\u201D. All parties\
        \ involved must post their One Rep Max in one of the following events: the\
        \ Barbell Squat, Barbell Benchpress, or Standing Overhead Barbell Press with\
        \ video evidence.\r\nThe Barbell Squat is defined as a strength exercise in\
        \ which the player lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands\
        \ back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while\
        \ the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and\
        \ the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up. The player must have the\
        \ weight centered on their back, and ensure their hips descend further than\
        \ their knees during the movement.\r\nThe Barbell Benchpress is defined as\
        \ an upper-body weight training exercise in which the player presses a barbell\
        \ upwards while lying on a bench/flat surface. The player performing the exercise\
        \ lies on their back on a bench/flat surface with a barbell grasped in both\
        \ hands. They lower the barbell to chest level, then press the barbell upwards,\
        \ extending the arms until the elbows are locked out.\r\nThe Standing Overhead\
        \ Barbell Press is defined as by taking a barbell and putting it in a racking\
        \ position. This can be done by taking the weight from a rack or by cleaning\
        \ the weight from the floor The weight is then pressed to overhead until the\
        \ elbows are fully locked out. As the weight clears the head, the player leans\
        \ forward slightly or comes directly under. As the weight is lowered back\
        \ to the racking position and clears the head again, the lifter leans slightly\
        \ back.\r\nWhen a \u201CLift-off\u201D is invoked, the accusing player(s)\
        \ must decide what event the \u201CLift-Off\u201D will be in. In the case\
        \ of multiple accusing players that cannot come to a consensus in event, the\
        \ \u201CLift-Off\u201D will default into the Barbell Benchpress event. \r\n\
        All parties involved have 72 hours after a player calls a \u201CLift-Off\u201D\
        \ to post their video evidence of them completing the event in the #Game text\
        \ channel in the Nomic V discord. The player must say the word \u201CNomic!\u201D\
        \ at an audible level in the video after completing the event. \r\nWhen a\
        \ \u201CLift-Off\u201D is declared, the ruling/legality/interpretation freezes\
        \ until both parties post their evidence of completing the decided-on event,\
        \ or the allotted time passes. \r\nThe player that completes the event with\
        \ the most weight on the barbell, measured in the empirical unit of lbs.,\
        \ will be declared the winner of the \u201CLift-Off\u201D. The winner may\
        \ then decide the ruling on the specific legality of a move or the interpretation\
        \ or application of a rule.  \r\n"

    \ the question. Said player is to be selected uniformly at random. Disagreement\
    \ for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player.\
    \ This process is called invoking Judgment. \n \nA player is eligible to be selected\
    \ as Judge if and only if all of the following are true: \n \n* The player is\
    \ active \n* The player has voted on the most recent proposal put to vote, or\
    \ the player has voted on the second most recent proposal put to vote, or no more\
    \ than two proposals have been put to vote since the start of the game \n* The\
    \ player has not proposed a rule-change currently being voted on \n* The player\
    \ has not yet been Judge this turn \n \nWhen Judgment is invoked for the first\
    \ time in a turn, the current turn is extended by 24 hours unless the scheduled\
    \ end of the turn was already more than 24 hours after Judgment\u2019s invocation.\
    \ If the turn is extended in this manner, and there are still more than 24 hours\
    \ left in the turn, a majority of active players may consent to revoke the extension.\
    \ \n \nThe Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by either a unanimous vote of\
    \ the other active players taken before the next turn is begun or a majority vote\
    \ of server moderators before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is\
    \ overruled, then another eligible player becomes the new Judge for the question,\
    \ and so on. \n \nThe server moderators can only overrule a Judge\u2019s Judgment\
    \ if the Judgment egregiously conflicts with the rules and would cause lasting\
    \ damage to the game. A majority vote of the other active players, taken before\
    \ the next turn is begun, may nullify the overruling, in which case the original\
    \ Judgment stands, the original Judge resumes their position as Judge, all Judgments\
    \ issued by Judges between the overruling and the nullification of the overruling\
    \ are nullified, and the server moderators are barred from overruling the Judge\
    \ for the remainder of the turn.  \n \nUnless a Judge is overruled, one Judge\
    \ settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including\
    \ questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge. \n \nNew\
    \ Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however,\
    \ settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that\
    \ affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions\
    \ by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when\
    \ the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the\
    \ Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying\
    \ other standards. \n \n"
  215: "215 \n \nIf the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if\
    \ the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's\
    \ best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then\
    \ the proposer of the proposal up for vote is the winner. If there is no proposal\
    \ up for vote, then the proposer of the proposal at the front of the Proposal\
    \ Queue at the time the game has become unplayable is the winner. If the Proposal\
    \ Queue is empty, then there is no winner. \n \nThis rule takes precedence over\
    \ every other rule determining the winner. \n \n"
  216: "216 \n \nPersons wishing to become players may join by requesting to do so\
    \ publicly. Persons may not act as multiple players at once. Persons that are\
    \ found to have done this are banned from the game. \n"
